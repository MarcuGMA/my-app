      <h1>ABOUT GAME</h1>
      <p>
        A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for
        entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool. Many
        games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of
        spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games
        involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video
        games). Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for
        achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or
        online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an
        audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching
        a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may
        constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often,
        part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is
        part of their audience and who is a player. A toy and a game are not the
        same. Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games present
        rules for the player to follow. Key components of games are goals,
        rules, challenge, and interaction. Games generally involve mental or
        physical stimulation, and often both. Many games help develop practical
        skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an
        educational, simulational, or psychological role.

        Ludwig Wittgenstein was probably the first academic philosopher to
        address the definition of the word game. In his Philosophical
        Investigations, Wittgenstein argued that the elements of games, such as
        play, rules, and competition, all fail to adequately define what games
        are. From this, Wittgenstein concluded that people apply the term game
        to a range of disparate human activities that bear to one another only
        what one might call family resemblances. As the following game
        definitions show, this conclusion was not a final one and today many
        philosophers, like Thomas Hurka, think that Wittgenstein was wrong and
        that Bernard Suits' definition is a good answer to the problem.
